Long term
Automate the three inputs in to plant growth via Pi 3b:
- Water
- Light
- Nutrients

Starting with cress.

Water:
Moisture sensor(s) periodicaly check soil mouisture
If too dry, dipesense sufficient water

Light
Wifi enabled slight socket. UV emmiting light bulb. On timer. 

Nutrients
TBC. Dispensed in water. Secondary tank?

Feedback
Via camera. 'Green' detection - numeric output

Automation
Via Neural Network optimising for 'green' Each cress crop (approx 2 weeks) a new epoch
Run >= 2 tests concurrently.

Steps:
1) Mositure sensor in basil
2) Mositure sensor + water pump in container
3) Add wifi light and move to dark conditions
4) Add camera
5) Add Neural Network to govern conditions
6) Begin testing
